## 3. Trigger Boundary Evaluation Evidence

| Skill Name | Should Trigger | Should Not Trigger | Ambiguous Neighbor Query |
|---|---|---|---|
| `copywriting` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize copywriting tasks (specifically configuring or implementing copywriting specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside copywriting or unrelated operations outside copywriting. | User asks 'How do I handle copywriting in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized copywriting procedures or general copywriting tooling. |
| `copywriting-psychologist` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize copywriting psychologist tasks (specifically configuring or implementing copywriting psychologist specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside copywriting psychologist or unrelated operations outside copywriting psychologist. | User asks 'How do I handle copywriting psychologist in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized copywriting psychologist procedures or general copywriting tooling. |
| `devrel-content` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize devrel content tasks (specifically configuring or implementing devrel content specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside devrel content or unrelated operations outside devrel content. | User asks 'How do I handle devrel content in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized devrel content procedures or general copywriting tooling. |
| `professional-proofreader` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize professional proofreader tasks (specifically configuring or implementing professional proofreader specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside professional proofreader or unrelated operations outside professional proofreader. | User asks 'How do I handle professional proofreader in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized professional proofreader procedures or general copywriting tooling. |
