|---|---|---|---|
| `puppeteer-skill` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize puppeteer skill tasks (specifically configuring or implementing puppeteer skill specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside puppeteer skill or unrelated operations outside puppeteer skill. | User asks 'How do I handle puppeteer skill in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized puppeteer skill procedures or general web-scraping tooling. |
| `web-scraper` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize web scraper tasks (specifically configuring or implementing web scraper specifications). | User requests A simpler, more specific tool can handle the request or unrelated operations outside web scraper. | User asks 'How do I handle web scraper in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized web scraper procedures or general web-scraping tooling. |
