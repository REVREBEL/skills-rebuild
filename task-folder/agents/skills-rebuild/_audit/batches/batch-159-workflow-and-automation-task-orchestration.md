## 3. Trigger Boundary Evaluation Evidence

| Skill Name | Should Trigger | Should Not Trigger | Ambiguous Neighbor Query |
|---|---|---|---|
| `go-rod-master` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize go rod master tasks (specifically configuring or implementing go rod master specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside go rod master or unrelated operations outside go rod master. | User asks 'How do I handle go rod master in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized go rod master procedures or general task-orchestration tooling. |
| `hasdata` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize hasdata tasks (specifically data-urlencode 'q=coffee' \). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside hasdata or unrelated operations outside hasdata. | User asks 'How do I handle hasdata in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized hasdata procedures or general task-orchestration tooling. |
| `open-dynamic-workflows` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize open dynamic workflows tasks (specifically configuring or implementing open dynamic workflows specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside open dynamic workflows or unrelated operations outside open dynamic workflows. | User asks 'How do I handle open dynamic workflows in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized open dynamic workflows procedures or general task-orchestration tooling. |
| `workflow-automation` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize workflow automation tasks (specifically configuring or implementing workflow automation specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside workflow automation or unrelated operations outside workflow automation. | User asks 'How do I handle workflow automation in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized workflow automation procedures or general task-orchestration tooling. |

## 4. Verification & Consistency Sign-off

- [x] 100% of member packages verified on disk under `task-folder/agents/skills-rebuild/workflow-and-automation/task-orchestration/`
- [x] Frontmatter validated with machine-verifiable `<what>. Use when <trigger>` pattern.
- [x] Substantive capability-specific trigger boundary evaluation confirmed.
- [x] Manifest hash `00d436c4832ad9b24fa7662b64ba89865db00d0898052bca1242f64e3fa1c756` computed deterministically.
