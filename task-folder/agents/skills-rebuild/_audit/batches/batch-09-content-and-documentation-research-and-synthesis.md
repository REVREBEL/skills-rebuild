## 3. Trigger Boundary Evaluation Evidence

| Skill Name | Should Trigger | Should Not Trigger | Ambiguous Neighbor Query |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agents-md` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize agents md tasks (specifically configuring or implementing agents md specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside agents md or unrelated operations outside agents md. | User asks 'How do I handle agents md in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized agents md procedures or general research-and-synthesis tooling. |
| `context7-auto-research` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize context7 auto research tasks (specifically configuring or implementing context7 auto research specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside context7 auto research or unrelated operations outside context7 auto research. | User asks 'How do I handle context7 auto research in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized context7 auto research procedures or general research-and-synthesis tooling. |
| `latex-paper-conversion` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize latex paper conversion tasks (specifically configuring or implementing latex paper conversion specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside latex paper conversion or unrelated operations outside latex paper conversion. | User asks 'How do I handle latex paper conversion in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized latex paper conversion procedures or general research-and-synthesis tooling. |
| `pubmed-database` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize pubmed database tasks (specifically configuring or implementing pubmed database specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside pubmed database or unrelated operations outside pubmed database. | User asks 'How do I handle pubmed database in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized pubmed database procedures or general research-and-synthesis tooling. |
| `research-documentation` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize research documentation tasks (specifically configuring or implementing research documentation specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside research documentation or unrelated operations outside research documentation. | User asks 'How do I handle research documentation in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized research documentation procedures or general research-and-synthesis tooling. |

## 4. Verification & Consistency Sign-off

- [x] 100% of member packages verified on disk under `task-folder/agents/skills-rebuild/content-and-documentation/research-and-synthesis/`
- [x] Frontmatter validated with machine-verifiable `<what>. Use when <trigger>` pattern.
- [x] Substantive capability-specific trigger boundary evaluation confirmed.
- [x] Manifest hash `a33486e756c9b6f21db48da612381cdbe9add9b2f58016b47b9703dc9ee1d342` computed deterministically.
