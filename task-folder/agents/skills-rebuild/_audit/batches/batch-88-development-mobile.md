## 3. Trigger Boundary Evaluation Evidence

| Skill Name | Should Trigger | Should Not Trigger | Ambiguous Neighbor Query |
|---|---|---|---|
| `attack-tree-construction` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize attack tree construction tasks (specifically configuring or implementing attack tree construction specifications). | User requests You lack authorization or a defined scope to model the system or unrelated operations outside attack tree construction. | User asks 'How do I handle attack tree construction in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized attack tree construction procedures or general mobile tooling. |
| `cms-collection-setup` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize cms collection setup tasks (specifically configuring or implementing cms collection setup specifications). | User requests All tool calls must include the required `context` parameter (15-25 words, third-person perspective) or unrelated operations outside cms collection setup. | User asks 'How do I handle cms collection setup in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized cms collection setup procedures or general mobile tooling. |
| `headline-psychologist` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize headline psychologist tasks (specifically configuring or implementing headline psychologist specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside headline psychologist or unrelated operations outside headline psychologist. | User asks 'How do I handle headline psychologist in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized headline psychologist procedures or general mobile tooling. |
| `interactive-portfolio` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize interactive portfolio tasks (specifically Role**: Portfolio Experience Designer). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside interactive portfolio or unrelated operations outside interactive portfolio. | User asks 'How do I handle interactive portfolio in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized interactive portfolio procedures or general mobile tooling. |
| `kotlin` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize kotlin tasks (specifically configuring or implementing kotlin specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside kotlin or unrelated operations outside kotlin. | User asks 'How do I handle kotlin in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized kotlin procedures or general mobile tooling. |
| `macos-menubar-tuist-app` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize macos menubar tuist app tasks (specifically configuring or implementing macos menubar tuist app specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside macos menubar tuist app or unrelated operations outside macos menubar tuist app. | User asks 'How do I handle macos menubar tuist app in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized macos menubar tuist app procedures or general mobile tooling. |
| `macos-spm-app-packaging` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize macos spm app packaging tasks (specifically configuring or implementing macos spm app packaging specifications). | User requests Sparkle relies on the bundle build number (`CFBundleVersion`), so `BUILD_NUMBER` in `version.env` must increase for each update or unrelated operations outside macos spm app packaging. | User asks 'How do I handle macos spm app packaging in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized macos spm app packaging procedures or general mobile tooling. |
| `swift` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize swift tasks (specifically configuring or implementing swift specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside swift or unrelated operations outside swift. | User asks 'How do I handle swift in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized swift procedures or general mobile tooling. |
