## 3. Trigger Boundary Evaluation Evidence

| Skill Name | Should Trigger | Should Not Trigger | Ambiguous Neighbor Query |
|---|---|---|---|
| `arrowspace` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize arrowspace tasks (specifically configuring or implementing arrowspace specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside arrowspace or unrelated operations outside arrowspace. | User asks 'How do I handle arrowspace in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized arrowspace procedures or general vector-databases tooling. |
| `context-manager` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize context manager tasks (specifically configuring or implementing context manager specifications). | User requests You need a different domain or tool outside this scope or unrelated operations outside context manager. | User asks 'How do I handle context manager in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized context manager procedures or general vector-databases tooling. |
| `embedding-strategies` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize embedding strategies tasks (specifically configuring or implementing embedding strategies specifications). | User requests You need a different domain or tool outside this scope or unrelated operations outside embedding strategies. | User asks 'How do I handle embedding strategies in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized embedding strategies procedures or general vector-databases tooling. |
| `similarity-search-patterns` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize similarity search patterns tasks (specifically configuring or implementing similarity search patterns specifications). | User requests You need a different domain or tool outside this scope or unrelated operations outside similarity search patterns. | User asks 'How do I handle similarity search patterns in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized similarity search patterns procedures or general vector-databases tooling. |
| `weaviate` | User asks to implement, configure, or optimize weaviate tasks (specifically configuring or implementing weaviate specifications). | User requests general infrastructure administration, styling, or unrelated operations outside weaviate or unrelated operations outside weaviate. | User asks 'How do I handle weaviate in my workflow?' -> Disambiguate: Clarify whether the task requires specialized weaviate procedures or general vector-databases tooling. |
