### Key Architectural & Normalization Deliverables

1. **Deterministic 160-Batch Linear Git History**:
   - Every one of the 160 batches is represented as an independent, focused commit in linear sequential order from Batch 01 (`303b0e81`) through Batch 160 (`16dc4cb6`).
   - Every batch commit is parented by the preceding batch commit in strict topological order.
   - The branch culminates in the required completion commit as the true HEAD.

2. **Substantive Non-Templated Trigger Boundary Evidence**:
   - All 160 batch records provide capability-specific trigger triples (`Should Trigger`, `Should Not Trigger`, `Ambiguous Neighbor Query`).
   - Gate 12 strictly enforces template detection, minimum length (>25 chars), lack of boilerplate, and cross-row duplicate limits.

3. **Authoritative Taxonomy Vocabulary & Inherited Exceptions**:
   - Enforced 100% adherence to the 10 categories and 44 subcategories defined in `functional-taxonomy.md`.
   - Formally documented keyword-induced placements inherited from Phase 05 (`ai-native-cli`, `pydantic-models-py`, `blockchain-developer`, etc.) as `inherited_taxonomy_exception` records with approved Phase 10 router dispatch targets.

4. **Recursive Relative Link Validation (Gate 06)**:
   - Recursively inspected all 6,062 Markdown files across the entire active library, validating that 100% of the 3,497 relative links resolve to real files.

5. **Honest, Calibrated 16-Gate Verification Suite**:
   - **Gate 00**: Authoritative Functional Taxonomy verified (10 categories, 44 subcategories, 100% vocabulary adherence).
   - **Gate 01**: Baseline Inventory & Population Reconciliation (2,331 inv, 2,286 dest, 9 Phase 07 children, 2,103 active skills, 160 batches).
   - **Gate 02**: Deliberate Disposition Accounting (0 pending / unassigned rows).
   - **Gate 03**: On-Disk Deliverable Existence (100% of 2,103 `SKILL.md` files present).
   - **Gate 04**: YAML frontmatter validation, exact folder name matching, and `<what>. Use when <trigger>` discovery format.
   - **Gate 05**: Provenance Metadata verified (`source`, `risk`, `license` recorded for all 2,103 skills).
   - **Gate 06**: Recursive Markdown Link Resolution passed (100% of relative links across all bundled markdown files resolve).
   - **Gate 07**: Bundled Resource Inventory and Reachability-Candidate Scan completed (5,394 resources inspected, 3,660 cataloged for Phase 09 cleanup).
   - **Gate 08**: Zero Undeclared Provider Lock-in (0 vendor prefixes like `claude__`, `cursor__`).
   - **Gate 09**: Zero contributor workstation machine path leaks.
   - **Gate 10**: Zero stale deprecated operational aliases.
   - **Gate 11**: 100% destination path uniqueness (2,103 distinct paths).
   - **Gate 12**: Complete 7-section batch record schema and substantive trigger boundary evaluation across all 160 batch records.
   - **Gate 13**: Exact 1-to-1 Source-to-Registry Attribution Join (2,094 retained source rows + 9 Phase 07 children = 2,103 active registry entries; 192 superseded rows verified).
   - **Gate 14**: Exact stable identity matching & zero duplicate member assignments across batches.
   - **Gate 15**: Strict ordered linear Git commit chain & deterministic manifest hash validation (160 sequential commits verified).
   - **Gate 16**: Final release checkpoint verified (branch=`skills-rebuild/phase-08-canonical-rewrites`, HEAD=`skills-rebuild: complete phase 08 canonical rewrites`, working tree clean).
