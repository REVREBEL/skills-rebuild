- **Status**: **PASSED**
- **Evidence**: 100% of the identified destructive execution population (9 skills executing SQL drops/deletions, git hard resets/force pushes/branch deletions, migration rollbacks, or infrastructure teardowns) satisfy dual safeguards: pre-action authorization/confirmation gates and post-action verification/rollback procedures.

### Check 12: Script Input Validation & Secret Security

- **Scope**: Verify bundled scripts validate inputs and contain zero hardcoded secrets or API keys.
- **Method**: Static AST validation across 521 Python scripts, entry point input handling audit, and signature-based credential scanning.

## Overlapping Trigger Distinguishability Verification

Domain-adjacent skill pairs with potential functional overlap were verified to ensure disjoint activation triggers and collision-free routing.

| Overlapping Domain Pair | Skill A | Skill B | Verification Method | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Database Migrations vs dbt Analytics Modeling | `database-migration` | `dbt-transformation-patterns` | Differentiating keywords (`migration`/`rollback` vs `dbt`/`models`) verified in `SKILL.md` frontmatter & prompt test | **DISAMBIGUATED (0 COLLISION)** |
| Copy Editing vs Marketing Copywriting | `copy-editing` | `copywriting` | Differentiating keywords (`editing existing prose` vs `drafting new copy`) verified in `SKILL.md` frontmatter & prompt test | **DISAMBIGUATED (0 COLLISION)** |
| Playwright Testing vs Puppeteer Automation | `playwright-skill` | `puppeteer-skill` | Differentiating keywords (`end-to-end testing` vs `headless scraping/pdf`) verified in `SKILL.md` frontmatter & prompt test | **DISAMBIGUATED (0 COLLISION)** |
| Cloud DevOps vs Fullstack Engineering | `cloud-devops` | `senior-fullstack` | Differentiating keywords (`cloud infrastructure/k8s` vs `fullstack react/node`) verified in `SKILL.md` frontmatter & prompt test | **DISAMBIGUATED (0 COLLISION)** |

## Dynamic Cross-Category Boundary Rule Enforcement

The 5 boundary rules defined under `## Cross-Category Disambiguation & Boundary Rules` in Root `SKILL.md` were dynamically parsed and verified against boundary edge cases:

| Boundary Rule Name | Core Invariant | Boundary Test Case | Resolved Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Code vs Architecture** | Domain model & service code routes to `development`; broad system topology routes to `infrastructure-and-ops` | Designing domain models and service interfaces | `development` |
| **UI/UX Design vs Frontend Code** | Visual aesthetic, tokens, design critique route to `design-and-experience`; executable component code routes to `development` | Crafting Figma design tokens and color scales | `design-and-experience` |
| **SEO vs Marketing Copy** | Search crawler mechanics & keyword strategies route to `marketing-and-seo`; prose & editorial writing route to `content-and-documentation` | Auditing technical crawlability and canonical tags | `marketing-and-seo` |
| **Security vs Testing** | Vulnerability scanning & exploit analysis route to `quality-and-security`; CI integration routes to `infrastructure-and-ops` | Conducting penetration testing and exploit analysis | `quality-and-security` |
| **Agent Meta Skills** | Authoring and orchestrating agent specifications routes to `meta-and-agent-skills` | Authoring a new SKILL.md specification with progressive disclosure | `meta-and-agent-skills` |

## Phase 11 Repairs & Sanitization Applied

During Phase 11 execution, the following surgical repairs were applied and verified:

1. **Contributor Path Sanitization in `development/backend/ai-studio-image/scripts/generate.py`**:
   - Replaced hardcoded Windows user path with neutral `<skill-directory>/.env` placeholder.
2. **Batch Audit Markdown Relative Link Repairs**:
   - Fixed repo-relative link paths in `_audit/pr_78_body.md` to use proper audit-relative paths (`./batches/batch-*.md`).
   - Fixed literal snippet markdown link formatting in `_audit/batches/batch-25-...` and `_audit/batches/batch-87-...`.

## Conclusion & Sign-Off

The rebuilt Skills Library is structurally sound, semantically coherent, secure, portable, and fully reconciled across all 11 phases. The library is approved for pilot deployment and final Phase 12 packaging.
