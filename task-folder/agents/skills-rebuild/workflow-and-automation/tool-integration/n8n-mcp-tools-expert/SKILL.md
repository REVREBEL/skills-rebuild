# n8n MCP Tools Expert

Leverage Model Context Protocol (`n8n-mcp`) tools to discover, configure, validate, and manage n8n workflows programmatically.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Operating in an agent environment equipped with the `n8n-mcp` tool server.
- Searching for available n8n nodes, supported operations, and required properties programmatically.
- Validating n8n node configurations against live node schemas before deployment.
- Searching and retrieving community workflow templates from the n8n template library.

Do not use this skill for:
- Writing custom FastMCP servers in Python or TypeScript (use `mcp-builder-ms`).
- Direct manual editing in the n8n visual UI without MCP tools.

## Prerequisites

- Active `n8n-mcp` server configured in the agent runtime.
- Network connectivity to target n8n instance API.

## Core Tool Capabilities

### 1. Node Discovery & Documentation
- `search_nodes`: Search for nodes by keyword, category, or service name (e.g. "airtable", "postgres", "slack").
- `get_node_info`: Retrieve comprehensive metadata, supported resources, operations, and property schemas for a specific node type.

### 2. Configuration Validation
- `validate_node_config`: Submit proposed node parameters to verify compliance against required fields, valid enum values, and type expectations.
- `validate_workflow`: Validate an entire exported workflow JSON structure for disconnected nodes or invalid parameter bindings.

### 3. Template Search & Deployment
- `search_templates`: Search over 2,700+ verified workflow templates by use case, integrated apps, or categories.
- `get_template`: Retrieve full workflow JSON for a template ID ready for customization.

## Recommended Tool Calling Workflow

1. **Discover**: Call `search_nodes` to identify exact node type names (e.g. `n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest`).
2. **Inspect**: Call `get_node_info` with the specific `resource` and `operation` to inspect required properties.
3. **Draft**: Construct the node parameter payload.
4. **Validate**: Call `validate_node_config` with the drafted payload to assert correctness before applying.

## Safety & Governance

- Never pass production secrets or unmasked API credentials into public template search queries.
- Validate workflow JSON schemas prior to executing programmatic deployment or activation calls.

## Completion Evidence

- Successful discovery and validation responses returned by `n8n-mcp` tools.
- Generated workflow configurations pass validation without schema rejections.
