# WordPress Development Workflow Bundle

Coordinate WordPress engineering workflows across core administration, themes, plugins, e-commerce, performance optimization, security, testing, and deployment.

## Overview

WordPress powers modern web applications ranging from decoupled publishing systems to complex e-commerce platforms. This router coordinates specialized skills for core administration, theme engineering, custom plugin development, WooCommerce, and performance tuning.

## WordPress 7.0 Features (Backward Compatible)

### Real-Time Collaboration (RTC)
Native collaborative editing engine for block editing and RTC-compatible post meta.

### AI Connectors API
Standardized endpoint integration for LLM and generative AI services.

### Abilities API (Stable in 7.0)
Granular capability registration for plugin actions and workflow automation.

### DataViews & DataForm
Modern administrative UI components for dataset management and block templates.

### PHP-Only Block Registration
Streamlined server-side block registration without JavaScript toolchain overhead.

### Interactivity API Updates
Declarative frontend reactive directives and client-side navigation.

### Admin Refresh
Next-generation responsive administrative design and navigation.

### Pattern Editing
Enhanced pattern creation and full-page layout composition tools.

## When to Use This Workflow

Use this master router to navigate complex WordPress development tasks across the full software lifecycle.

## Workflow Phases

- **Phase 1: WordPress Setup**: Core installation, multisite configuration, and WP-CLI automation.
- **Phase 2: Theme Development**: Block themes, `theme.json` styling, template hierarchy, and FSE.
- **Phase 3: Plugin Development**: Custom post types, REST API endpoints, AI Connectors, and Abilities API.
- **Phase 4: WooCommerce Integration**: Product models, checkout flows, and payment integrations.
- **Phase 5: Performance Optimization**: Object caching, query tuning, and asset optimization.
- **Phase 6: Security Hardening**: Permissions, salt rotation, and XML-RPC disablement.
- **Phase 7: Testing**: PHPUnit, WP-CLI test runner, and Playwright verification.
- **Phase 8: Deployment**: Database migrations, search-replace, and zero-downtime rollouts.

## Decision Matrix & Routing Table

| User Goal | Focus Area | Specialized Child Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Core setup, multisite config, WP-CLI automation, deployment, security hardening | Core & Admin | [WordPress Core & Admin](./wordpress-core-admin/SKILL.md) |
| Block themes, `theme.json`, template hierarchy, FSE styling, PHP block registration | Theme Engineering | [WordPress Theme Development](./wordpress-theme-development/SKILL.md) |
| Custom plugins, action/filter hooks, REST API routes, AI Connectors, Abilities API | Plugin Engineering | [WordPress Plugin Development](./wordpress-plugin-development/SKILL.md) |
| WooCommerce catalog, custom cart/checkout, payment gateways, product data models | E-Commerce | [WordPress WooCommerce](./wordpress-woocommerce/SKILL.md) |
| Object caching (Redis), query profiling, asset minification, database indexing | Performance | [WordPress Performance Optimization](./wordpress-performance-optimization/SKILL.md) |

## WordPress-Specific Workflows

Refer to specialized child skills for detailed workflow implementations across Custom Post Types, Custom REST Endpoints, AI Connectors, PHP-only blocks, Abilities API, and WooCommerce Product Types.

## Quality Gates

- **Coding Standards**: Enforce `WordPress-Core`, `WordPress-Docs`, and `WordPress-Extra` via PHP_CodeSniffer.
- **Security Hardening**: Sanitize all inputs (`sanitize_text_field`), validate nonces (`wp_verify_nonce`), escape all outputs (`esc_html`, `esc_attr`), and use `$wpdb->prepare()`.
- **Testing Priorities**: Unit testing with PHPUnit, integration testing with WP-CLI test runner, and Playwright for frontend block interactions.

## Related Workflow Bundles

- **PHP Backend Engineering**: Modern PHP 8.1+ practices.
- **Gutenberg & React**: Custom block creation with React.
- **Infrastructure**: Redis object cache and MariaDB database tuning.

## Limitations

Requires PHP 8.1+ and MySQL 8.0+ / MariaDB 10.5+ for modern WordPress 7.0 feature compatibility.
